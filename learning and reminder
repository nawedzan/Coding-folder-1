here i will write what i learned and put reminder for tommorrow

there is local repository and remote repository 
any time a file is brought in the local repository to modify 
it is not sure that it will get pushed to the remote repo 

if you encounter this error "Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do not have locally"

than the remote has been changed 

to fix this error pull the repo in the local dev than to update the repo of the current changes

than push the your local repo back in.

git status checks whether there is a repo in the folder or not , because if there is than running git init again can lead to confusiions as git is watching git

git status also tells what files have been made but are not tracked by the git.

-------------- working tree clean meaning ------------------------

working tree clean means git is traking everything it also shows nothing to commit which means the same.

----------------- Delete -----------------------

to delete a folder which is already in staging area first delete it from the working repo by using "rm <filename>" command.
but the folder is still in the staging area.
 delete the file from the staging area by using the command "git rm <filename>.
